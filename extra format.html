<h3>Our Solution</h3>
<h6>Sit and cry tbh</h6>
<p>Its estimated the ocean produces between 50 and a staggering 80% of the world's oxygen. Through 
  carbon bleaching and massive ecosystem disruption, this could very soon change. Further air 
  pollution poses huge health risks, not to mention the potential further environmental damage#
  that could cascade from such a loss.
</p>
<h6>Solution 2 I guess</h6>
<p>For both humans and animals alike, the Oceans provide a huge variety of food. The ecosystem is vast -
  fish are a staple of many diets, and the interdependance within the ecosystem is crucial to environmental
  stability.

<h6>Fancy Bubble Chart incoming??</h6>
<p>The ocean covers a huge 70% of the surface of the Earth; and as such regulates the water cycle and 
  many climate processes. These include: heat transfer, weather patterns, and even extreme weather 
  events such as hurricanes. 98% of the heat from the Sun's rays is absorbed by the ocean and transferred
  across the planet.

<h6>Not yet</h6>
<p>Many ingredients and other medicinal materials are found in the ocean, including those helping treat 
  arthiritis, heart disease, and even cancer.</p>
<h6>Nearly!</h6>
<p>Many advantages to human happiness can be correlated to the ocean. Many studies  nature has a 
  direct impact on reducing stress, and mental and physical health are undeniably benefited by interacting
  with the natural world around us. Even swimming is a very healthy process provided by the ocean, with breathing
  patterns releasing important hormones into our system. Even ocean sounds for meditation are often used with great
  results.
</p>
<h6>Just after this!</h6>
<p>The oceans are an unmatched source of wildlife, growth, and thriving ecosystems. Its predicted the 
  world's oceans contain between half a million and an incredible 10 million species - we have barely
  touched the surface! In fact, more than 80% of the ocean remains unexplored.
